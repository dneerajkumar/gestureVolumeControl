# gestureVolumeControl
Using OpenCv You can control your PC's Volume with a gesture

This Little Project is the collaboration of two open source libraries i.e MediaPipe and OpenCv

Basically i have created a module named as "handTrackingModule.py" which is used to detect the motion of the hand and provides a support to any program that requires a hand motion detection
the only thing you have to do is import the .py file and Prepare a required file which does further intended output.

Here volumeHandControl.py is responsible to give you the intended output i.e main code which controls your system's volume.
